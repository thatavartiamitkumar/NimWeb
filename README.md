# Nim Game Agent

##Introdcution##
<p>Nim game is a mathematical strategy game which involves stacks, tokens and two players who takes alternate turn to play the game. It is a perfect knowledge game where both players know the all the moves made.</p>
<p>Each player need to select a stack and remove 1/2/3 tokens from the selected stack. Player who picks up the last token loses the game, this is miser version of game.
In this project we made the computer intelligent enough to think against the human player to play.</p>


##Approach
We used following strategy to solve this problem
-	Building State space
-	MiniMax Algorithm
